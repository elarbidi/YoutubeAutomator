Self-awareness refers to the capacity to perceive and comprehend one's own emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. It is the ability to observe, evaluate and reflect on one's own experiences, and develop insight into one's beliefs, values, and motivations. 

When we possess self-awareness, we know who we are, why we react the way we do, and how our behaviors can impact our lives and relationships. Itâ€™s the ability to tune in to our mental and emotional states, to understand and manage our emotions, and to make informed decisions based on that understanding.

For instance, if we feel nervous before an important presentation, we can recognize that emotion and evaluate how we can manage it, by taking deep breaths, practicing relaxation techniques or engaging in positive self-talk. Similarly, if we find ourselves procrastinating, we can identify why we are doing that, analyze our thought process, and develop strategies to overcome it.

In essence, self-awareness is the foundation of emotional intelligence and enables us to gain a better understanding of ourselves and others. It also helps us to build healthier relationships, make more informed decisions and pursue our goals with greater clarity and purpose.
